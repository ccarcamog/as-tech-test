# Applaudo Studios Technical Test - ETL Developer
Hi everyone! I this file, I will try to explaine the entire data analysis process to give a functional solution for the assessment case. Some resources will be sent via email. For any comments or questions you can contact me to email ccarcamog92@gmail.com.

## Solution Analysis
The requirement is based on a supermarket performance analysis. There are different data sources, achiving one goal: the unification of data for further analysis and visualizations. Based on this, the best approach is to implement a Big Data solution, to extract the data from multiple sources, transforme it via ETL processes and store it in a one and only data store (Data Warehouse).

As the solution will need a big Data approch, there are several ways to achive it, using a lot of tecnologies. To create a escalar, well-performed and easy to manage solution, the best approuch it take the solution to the cloud. For this assessment, I will develop the entire solution using AWS tools, except for data visualization, that I will be using Power BI.

## Data Architecture
Now that I have defined AWS as my cloud provider, the entire solution will take place using the following architecture:
